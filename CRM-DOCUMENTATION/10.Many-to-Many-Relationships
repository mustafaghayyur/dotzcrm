Many-to-Many CRUD Operations that can be used through out the system.
    
In a M2M relationship, there are two key columns to watch out for: 
    - FirstId: refers to the first FK of another table we are tracking
    - SecondId: refers to the second FK of yet, another table we wish
    the firstId to be associated with.

Note: first and second can carry significance for each specific 'Model' that inherits this class. Should be appropriately assigned in mapper.
