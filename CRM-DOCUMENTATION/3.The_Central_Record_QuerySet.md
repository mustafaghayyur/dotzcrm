The QuerySet family of definitions will be essential to maintaining strict data-integrity and database-interactions standards.

Where Django ORM's standard functions are not used to operate on the MySQL DB, these QuerySet methods should be used to interact with the MySQL DB.

DO NOT use raw queries anywhere outside of QuerySets in this project.
