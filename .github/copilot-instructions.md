# GitHub Copilot / AI Agent Instructions for Dotz CRM + PM Software 🔧

## Purpose
Concise, actionable guidance to get an AI coding agent productive in this repository quickly. Focus on the architecture, developer workflows, and project-specific conventions (not general best practices).

## Big picture (what to know first) ✅
- Monolithic Django app (Django 5.2.7) with modular apps: `core`, `tasks`, `tickets`, `documents`, `customers`, `restapi`. See `project/settings.py` for installed apps.
- Single CUD entry point: **all Create/Update/Delete must go through `restapi/`**; views outside `restapi` should only read data. See `restapi/README.md`.
- Data Relationship Manager (DRM) layer centralizes CRUD logic: look at `core/DRMcore/` (crud classes) and `core/DRMcore/querysets/` (query assembly). DRMs often compose SQL-like selectors/conditions rather than relying directly on Django model convenience.
- The `app_name/drm/mappers.py` are a type of way to define a loose schema for our system. They mapper classes often define valid ENUM values for DB column fields. Or which columns can be ignored in certain CRUD operations, etc... Consider mapper classes (where ever you find them in drm directories) to be a loose schem defining aparatus.

## Key patterns & concrete examples ⚠️
- LAWS OF CRUD: implement CUD in DRM classes and, when applicable, update the corresponding `core/DRMcore/querysets` logic. Example: change in tasks CRUD should touch `tasks/drm/crud.py` and any query logic in `core/DRMcore/querysets` or `tasks/drm/querysets`.
- Query assembly: QuerySetManager and mapper objects build selectors/conditions (see `core/DRMcore/querysets/background.py`); follow the selectors/conditions/limit style used across `restapi` views (e.g., `restapi/views/tasks.py`).
- REST endpoints use DRF `@api_view` and return paginated JSON with `results` — follow the shape in `restapi/views/tasks.py` (use `CRUD().read(...)`, serializers like `TaskO2ORecord`).
- Internal helper views: conventionally, view helpers prefixed with `_H_` are not directly exposed to URLs (see docstring in `restapi/views/tasks.py`).
- Logging: CRUD validation and logging occur via `core/DRMcore/crud/Validation.py` (calls `misc.log(..., crud=True)`); logs are written to `core/settings.py` configured path (`tasks['crud_logger_file']`, defaults to `/Users/mustafa/Sites/python/server1/CRUD.log`) and only when `DEBUG` is True.

## Developer workflows (commands & examples) 🔧
- Django: use `manage.py` for local tasks (e.g., `python manage.py runserver`, `python manage.py migrate`).
- Database: MySQL (see `project/settings.py`); recommended server settings in `CRM-DOCUMENTATION/7.MySQL-Server-Settings.md`.
- Frontend: inside `static/` run `npm install` and `npm run build` (or `npm run build:core` / `npm run build:tasks`). SASS compile: `sass ./scss/dotzstrap.scss:./css/dotzstrap.css`.
- Deployment: mod_wsgi is the expected production setup (top-level `README.md`).

## Logs & debugging 💡
- CRUD log: `core/settings.py` -> `tasks['crud_logger_file']` (default `/Users/mustafa/Sites/python/server1/CRUD.log`).
- Server logs: `logs/httpd/` (httpd) and `logs/mysqld/` (MySQL). Use these when debugging DB/HTTP issues.
- Note: there are currently no repository test suites detected — add targeted tests when changing DRM or API behavior.

## Conventions for AI edits ✍️
- When changing DB behavior:
  1) Please note that DRM's core logic has been developed in the core/DRMcore/ dir. However, each app (including `core`) will have a seperate `app_name/drm/` (in lower-case) directory, where implementations/inherited chidl classes referecncing specific tables/columns that relate to the app in question, will reside.
  2) Update the CRUD class-methods (e.g., found in `tasks/drm/crud.py`, `core/drm/crud.py`, or `tickets/drm/crud.py`), as the app needs to modify CRUD operations behaviour.
  3) Update the queryset methods to add specific READ-only custom queries where a fetch query is required in the system (in `app_name/drm/querysets.py`).
  4) Update any mapper info in `app_name/drm/mappers.py` taht will define schema relations, if you find this effecient.
  5) If the change exposes a new CUD surface, add a `restapi/` endpoint and corresponding validators/serializers (see `restapi/validators/tasks.py`).
- Use explicit file references in PR descriptions and code suggestions (e.g., “modify `tasks/drm/crud.py` and `tasks/drm/querysets/*`”).
- Preserve `context.results` convention when adding non-REST read views; keep error handling consistent with `restapi` patterns (use DRF `Response` and `status` codes).

## Where to look first (quick file pointers) 📎
- Core CRUD rules: `core/DRMcore/README.md`, `core/DRMcore/crud/Validation.py` (logging & validation)
- REST entry points: `restapi/README.md`, `restapi/views/`, `restapi/validators/`
- App DRM examples: `tasks/drm/crud.py`, `tasks/drm/querysets/` (and any future `app_name/drm/*` implemenetations that get added.)
- Settings & DB: `project/settings.py`, `core/settings.py`. Also `app_name/drm/*_mappers_*.py` are additional places where DRM settings may be found.
- Frontend: `static/package.json`, `static/README.md`, `webpack.config.js`

## Small checklist for PRs (recommended) ✅
- Make sure CUD logic lives in `app_name/drm/*` and relevant querysets are updated. You can also suggest changed to core/DRMcore/* files if some dit relates to DRM's core functionality or has project-wide implications.
- Add/modify REST endpoint in `restapi/` for any new CUD API.
- Update `core/settings.py` only for environment-specific defaults; do not leave `DEBUG=True` in production.
- Include short, specific QA steps (how to reproduce or verify the change locally).

When in doubt: prefer DRM + restapi changes over model or ad-hoc DB access. If you'd like, I can open a PR updating this file and include a short changelog entry; otherwise tell me any missing/incorrect bits and I'll revise the instructions. ✅
